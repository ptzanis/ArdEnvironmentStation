<h1> JCOP FW System Configuration Database</h1>
<p><a class="anchor" name="qstart_generalRemarks"><strong> General Remarks</strong></a> 
<p>There will be one System Configuration Database per experiment that will be 
  shared by all subdetectors. This database will be centrally mantained. In order 
  to use this functionality in production systems is encouraged that you contact 
  your central DCS team. However, it is also possible to use the database functionality 
  of the FW Component Installation Tool with you own database server for testing 
  purposes.
<p><a class="anchor" name="qstart_generalRemarks"><strong> Introduction</strong></a>
<p>The JCOP FW System Configuration Database stores the overall configuration 
  of the Detector Control System, namely: 
<ul>
  <li> Computers and all their relevant information like IP numbers and IPMI configuration 
  </li>
  <li> PVSS versions and patch level applied to each computer</li>
  <li> List of PVSS projects and their configuration in terms of: 
    <ul>
      <li> PVSS managers</li>
      <li> FW Component installed</li>
      <li> External processes associated with the project, e.g. OPC or DIM servers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The System Configuration Database is populated by the FW Component Installation 
  Tool. Versions 4.0.0. and higher of the Installation Tool feature an agent that 
  checks the consistency and synchronizes the contents of the running PVSS project 
  and the information in the System Configuration Database at regular time intervals.
<p>Once the FW Installation Tool is configured to use the FW System Configuration 
  DB, the user may choose if the project is locally or centrally managed. In the 
  local management mode, the installation of FW components is done from the main 
  panel of the installation tool as in previous versions. Moreover, in the local 
  mode, the running PVSS project is taken as the master source of information 
  and the contents of the database are updated accordingly. In a centrally managed 
  project, the database is taken as the master source of information and the components 
  installed in a project are modified in order to match the contents of the database. 
  This later mode of operation enables the installation of FW Components in multiple 
  projects from a central PVSS project.
<p>The contents of the System Configuration DB can be used to restore a PVSS project 
  in the event of failure. The System Configuration Database is also used by other 
  tools like the JCOP FW System Overview for their configuration..
